## Sequential code

In a sequential code, each line needs to complete execute before the next one start
to be executed as well.

In this example, we set 5 seconds to *backgroundTask* be completed, printing only it's begin and end. After that the 
function *printTaskTime* start, printing their progress every second, until finish.
